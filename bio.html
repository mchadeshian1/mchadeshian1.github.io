			Hi Everyone! My name is Mikael Hadeshian, but everyone calls me Miko, and I am currentlya junior majoring in Computer Science and Quantitative Economics at Tufts University just outside Boston. I was born on December 13, 1997 in San Francisco, California but quickly moved accross the bay to Berkeley where I grew up. I graduated from Berkeley High School in 2016. Some peaks included completing the international baccalaureate program and competing in a state championship in basketball. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I grew up in a multi-ethnic household where my mother was Uruguayan and my dad was Armenian. From the countless mate gourds strewn around my house and the strange sounding food like Boureks, that are a staple on my dining room table, to my unwavering support for the Uruguayan national team and the Kardashians, there are signs of my odd heritage everywhere. 
			</p>
			<p>
			These days, when i'm not studying, I love reading books, binge-watching netflix, coding, playing new sports (namely ultimate frisbee), traveling, and spending time with family and friends. I also have enjoyed spending my summers working with young students in the field of educational uplift.
