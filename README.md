# This was a project for the Web Development (COMP 20) course taught at Tufts University by Ming Chow in the Fall of 2018. This assignment consists of only HTML5 and CSS (no JavaScript).
# To my understanding the entire assignment has been completed and everything is implemented correctly with no errors.
# Spent ~5 hours completing the assignment. I received no help from other individuals. Did view source codes of various websites to get inspiration.
